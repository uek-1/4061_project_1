## How to compile the program:
To compile the program first clone the repo from github. 
Then you are going to cd into the repository and run the command “make”, then “./your inputs”. 
For example “./autograder 5 1”.

Breaking this down it is autograder<B><p1><p2>... 
For how many B batch numbers, and p(n) are your parameters.

## Any assumptions outside this document
Some assumptions outside of this document are that your computer can run C, you have a Linux system, 
and an understanding of cloning repositories/cd’ing into them.
