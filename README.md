## How to compile the program:
To compile the program first clone the repo from github. Then you are going to cd into the repository and run the command “make”, then “./your inputs”. For example “./autograder 5 1”.
Breaking this down it is autograder<B><p1><p2>... For how many B batch numbers, and p(n) are your parameters.

## Any assumptions outside this document
Some assumptions outside of this document are that your computer can run C, you have a Linux system, and an understanding of cloning repositories/cd’ing into them.
